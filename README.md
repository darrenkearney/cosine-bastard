My entry for Global Game Jam 2017 that never had a chance.

http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/cosine-bastard

Built with Godot engine. The source is under the Global Game Jam 2017 rules' license. 

This is my first time using Godot, and my second attempt at making a game all by myself at a game jam.
It was an attempt to teach me more about the open source engine moreso than make a decent game (I made pong in it too, but that's included in the examples.)
I thought I'd get more done in the Global Game Jam because it's more than 1 day, but hey, it turned out that I needed to refresh my secondary school level math before I could even think about what I wanted to make.
A game idea that's going to be shelved for a while, threateningly close to the bin.
